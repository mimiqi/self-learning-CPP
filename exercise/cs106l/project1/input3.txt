My home town is a beautiful place. It stands beside a wide river and is rich in fish and rice.　　But in the old days it was a poor and backward little town. Many people had no work. They lived a hard life.　　In 1949 my hometown was liberated. Since then great changes have taken place there. The streets have been widened. Factories, schools, hospitals, cinemas and theatres have sprung up one after another. The life of the people is greatly improved.www.t262.com　　I love my hometown. All the more I love its people. They are working hard so as to make it still richer and more beautiful.
